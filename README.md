# PreventScreenshot iOS Application

## Overview

PreventScreenshot is an iOS application developed in Objective-C that aims to prevent users from taking screenshots within the app. This functionality is achieved by detecting when a user attempts to take a screenshot and presenting an alert informing them that screenshots are not allowed.

## Features

- Detects when a user attempts to take a screenshot.
- Presents an alert message informing the user that screenshots are not allowed.
- Developed in Objective-C.

## Agenda

The primary goal of this project is to prevent users from taking screenshots within the app. The current implementation achieves this goal by leveraging native iOS APIs to detect screenshot events and presenting an alert to the user.

## Future Agenda

The future agenda for this project includes converting the existing codebase into a Cordova plugin. By converting the code into a plugin, it will become reusable across different Cordova projects, enabling developers to easily integrate the screenshot prevention functionality into their hybrid mobile applications.

## Usage

To use the PreventScreenshot application, simply clone the repository and open it in Xcode. Build and run the application on  a real iOS device. When the app is running, attempt to take a screenshot, and you should see an alert informing you that screenshots are not allowed.
